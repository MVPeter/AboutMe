        <h3>I am a single father.  I was born in Utah and have recently moved back from Oregon.  I worked in IT for 20 years prior to my move.  I have worked in desktop and server support for companies with hundreds of computers, laptops, and servers.  I've managed mail, file, print, domain servers for large call centers.  I have really enjoyed scripting, automation, and deployment.  I have been a stay at home father learning to navigate ASD with my son and am now trying to return to the work force.  Scripting and automation have led me to want to switch careers to development and coding. </h3>
